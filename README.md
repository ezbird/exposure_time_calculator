# exposure_time_calculator
Computes the approximate number of photons you will receive from a given astronomical source in a given amount of time for a given observational setup

USAGE: python3 exp_calc.py

Features to be added... 
  1. importing a wide range of filters (expected throughput by wavelength)
  2. importing coatings of mirrors (expected throughput by wavelength)
  3. including errors/uncertainty
